        The West African slave trade formed one of the most pivotal experiences
        in Africa's history. With the scramble and partition of Africa by the
        Portuguese and other European superpowers in the early 15th century,
        this commenced a dark period of slave trade in the history of West
        Africa.

        After discovery the coast of West Africa in one of its voyages,
        Portuguese soldiers started to capture Africans and hold them as slaves
        from the coast. Due to its proximity to the water, it was easy for the
        Portuguese to capture Africans and easily ship them to their home
        country.

        The slave trade in East Africa really took off from the 17th century.
        More and more merchants from Oman settled in Zanzibar. The island took
        on an even more important role in the international trade of goods due
        to the large trade at the Swahili coast and consequently also in the
        slave trade. This is how the largest slave market in East Africa was
        created.
        <br />
        <br />
        East Africa was a late participant in the transatlantic slave trade. It
        was only in the 1770s that a regular trade in slaves to the French
        islands of Mauritius and RÃ©union began from points on the East African
        coast. Small numbers of slaves had been carried around the Cape for more
        than a century. But as planters on St Domingue cried out for labour,
        this trade became more profitable and systematic, particularly as the
        French king agreed to subsidise the shipment of slaves to the island.
