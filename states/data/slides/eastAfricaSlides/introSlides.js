        More than six decades since most East African countries became
        independent, the region is at once a beacon of stability for the rest of
        the continent and a canvas for some of the most pressing issues of our
        time.
        <br />
        <br />
        Let’s explore East Africa in more detail, and then we will move on to
        the history of slavery.

        The spectre of ethnic identity stalks East Africa like few other places
        on the planet. The question lay at the heart of what happened in Burundi
        in 1993, in Rwanda in 1994 and in Kenya in 2007.
        <br />
        <br />
        More than a million East Africans lost their lives in these three
        conflicts in which a person's ethnic story took centre stage.

        There is, however, much to celebrate. Tanzania and, to a lesser extent,
        Uganda rarely make headlines, if at all, for issues of ethnic unrest –
        despite having more than 120 tribal groups, Tanzania is a model of
        nation-building and a place where ethnic conflict is extremely rare.
        <br />
        <br />
        More than that, four out of the five East African countries (Burundi is
        the exception) are at peace.

        Democracy's roots sink deeper into the East African soil with each
        passing election. While concerns remain as to whether opposition parties
        stand a real chance of victory in Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda, Kenya's
        experience suggests that the region's democratic institutions are
        stronger than many analysts dared hope.

        For all the plaudits East Africa receives for its stability and regular
        roster of elections, three countries are, as of late 2017, run by men
        who can't seem to let go of power.
        <br />
        <br />
        Yoweri Museveni of Uganda (in power since 1986), Paul Kagame of Rwanda
        (2000) and Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi (2005) have all amended their
        country's constitutions to allow themselves to seek additional
        presidential terms.
        <br />
        <br />
        The crackdown on opposition politicians and political protests that have
        accompanied the extensions is a worrying development.

        Drought has always stalked East Africa, with some parts of the region
        just one failed rainy season away from a major crisis.
        <br />
        <br />
        For all the growth in East Africa's urban middle class, much of the
        region's population continues to live at subsistence levels, wholly
        dependent upon the rains that sustain their crops or provide grazing for
        their livestock.
