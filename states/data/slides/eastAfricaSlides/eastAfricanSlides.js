        Slavery in the East Africa has a long history, beginning in the ancient
        Nubian and ancient Egyptian times and continuing up to the present.
        Prisoners of war were a regular occurrence in the ancient Nile Valley
        and Africa.
        <br />
        <br />
        During times of conquest and after winning battles, the
        ancient Egyptian were taken as slaves by the ancient nubians . In turn,
        the ancient Nubians took slaves after winning battles with the Libyans,
        Canaanites, and Egyptians.

        Soon after the Arab conquest of Egypt, the Arabs attempted to conquer
        the kingdoms of Christian Nubia on multiple occasions, but utilizing
        strategic guerilla-like warfare, the significantly smaller Christian
        Nubia defeated the larger Arab forces.
        <br />
        <br />
        Eventually, given their unsuccessful efforts, the Arabs signed the
        600-year Baqt treaty with the Christian Nubian kingdom of Makuria. As a
        part of the treaty, the Nubians, already involved in the burgeoning East
        African slave trade, agreed to trade 360 slaves annually to their
        northern neighbors in exchange for spices and grains.

        After the Nubian kingdoms' fall in 1504, the Ottomans conquered most of
        Nubia, while the Funj conquered much of East Africa, the Funj began to
        use slaves in the army in the reign of Badi III (r. 1692-1711).
        <br />
        <br />
        Later, Egyptian slavers began raiding modern East African. In
        particular, the ruler Muhammad Ali of Egypt attempted to build up an
        army of East African slaves with the aid of the Nubian slavers

        The island of Zanzibar is today considered one of East Africa's best
        destinations: white sandy beaches, crystal clear waters and hotels offer
        tourists from all over the world a holiday to remember. Long forgotten
        is the dark past that overshadowed this sunny paradise 200 years ago.

        The archipelago, which today is a semi-autonomous part of Tanzania, was
        then regarded as the center of the East African slave trade. In addition
        to valuable raw materials such as ivory and the coveted cloves, one
        thing stood out above all others in the colorful markets: hundreds of
        slaves

        The sale of African slaves can be traced back to antiquity. It became
        popular in the seventh century when Islam was gaining strength in North
        Africa. This was seven centuries before Europeans explored the continent
        and ten centuries before West Africans were sold across the Atlantic to
        America.

        In central East Africa, ethnic groups such as the Yao, Makua and Marava
        were fighting against each other and entire peoples within the continent
        traded with people they had captured through wars.
        <br />
        <br />
        Thus Arab Muslims encountered already existing structures, which
        facilitated the purchase of slaves for their purposes.

        Every year, about 40,000-50,000 slaves were taken to Zanzibar.About a
        third went to work on clove and coconut plantations of Zanzibar and
        Pemba while the rest were exported to Persia, Arabia, the Ottoman Empire
        and Egypt.
        <br />
        <br />
        Conditions on the plantations were so harsh that about 30% of the male
        slaves died every year, thus necessitating the need to import another
        batch of slaves

        According to British explorer and abolitionist Samuel Baker, who visited
        Khartoum in 1862, slavery was the industry "that kept Khartoum going as
        a bustling town". Baker described the practice of slave raiding of
        African villages to the south by slavers in Khartoum: An armed group
        would sail up the Nile, find a convenient African village, surround it
        during night and attack just before dawn, burning huts and shooting.
        <br />
        <br />
        Women and young adults would be captured and bound with "forked poles on
        their shoulders", hand tied to the pole in front, children bound to
        their mothers. To render "the village so poor that surviving inhabitants
        would be force to collaborate with slavers on their next excursion
        against neighboring villages," the village would be looted of cattle,
        grain, ivory, with everything else destroyed.
