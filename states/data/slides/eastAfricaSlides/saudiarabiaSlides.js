        The East African slave trade was also enormous in size and equally
        horrible compared to the Atlantic slave trade. Less slaves perished
        during the sea transport in the Dhows as the transport lasted fewer days
        than on the Atlantic trade. However large numbers of slaves perished
        when walking (often carrying ivory tusks or other goods) from the
        interior to the East African harbours for transport. During the 16th and
        17th century the East African slave-trade was controlled by the
        Portuguese with African and Arab support. The Omani Arabs controlled the
        slave-trade during the 18th and 19th century with Zanzibar being the
        main slave-market. Smaller slave markets existed in places like Muscat
        and Mukalla.

        slave ships carried large crews and the firepower needed to suppress any
        resistance.

        The East Africa slave trade reached its peak in 1789-90 when about 46
        ships, carrying more than 16,000 slaves, circumnavigated the Cape.
        Almost all were bound for the sugar and coffee plantations of northern
        St Domingue.

        Some French ships sold their entire cargo of slaves at the Cape while
        others provided the settlement with sugar, coffee and rice, and an
        assortment of commodities, most notably ivory and gold, to be shipped
        northwards to Europe.

        The plundering and burning of the sugar plantations in France’s
        wealthiest colony had destroyed the established market for East African
        slaves in the Americas.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Sao José was thus a pioneer, hoping to find a new market for East
        African slaves in Brazil. This was no easy matter, as traders in Angola
        and the Congo monopolised the sale of slaves to Portuguese America.

        Middle Passage, the forced voyage of enslaved Africans across the
        Atlantic Ocean to the New World. It was one leg of the triangular trade
        route that took goods (such as knives, guns, ammunition, cotton cloth,
        tools, and brass dishes) from Europe to Africa, Africans to work as
        slaves in the Americas and West Indies, and items, mostly raw materials,
        produced on the plantations (sugar, rice, tobacco, indigo, rum, and
        cotton) back to Europe.
        <br />
        <br />
        From about 1518 to the mid-19th century, millions of African men, women,
        and children made the 21-to-90-day voyage aboard grossly overcrowded
        sailing ships manned by crews mostly from Great Britain, the
        Netherlands, Portugal, and France.
