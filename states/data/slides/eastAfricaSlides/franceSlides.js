        East Africa was a late participant in the transatlantic slave trade. It
        was only in the 1770s that a regular trade in slaves to the French
        islands of Mauritius and Réunion began from points on the East African
        coast. Small numbers of slaves had been carried around the Cape for more
        than a century. But as planters on St Domingue cried out for labour,
        this trade became more profitable and systematic, particularly as the
        French king agreed to subsidise the shipment of slaves to the island.

        Ships sailed from French ports such as Bordeaux and Nantes to buy slaves
        in East Africa. The slaves were then taken to St Domingue and exchanged
        for tropical produce like sugar, coffee and indigo.
        <br />
        The size of these vessels grew in the 1780s and some had the capacity to
        carry up to 1000 slaves..

        slave ships carried large crews and the firepower needed to suppress any
        resistance. The East Africa slave trade reached its peak in 1789-90 when
        about 46 ships, carrying more than 16,000 slaves, circumnavigated the
        Cape.
        <br />
        <br />
        Almost all were bound for the sugar and coffee plantations of northern
        St Domingue.

        Some French ships sold their entire cargo of slaves at the Cape while
        others provided the settlement with sugar, coffee and rice, and an
        assortment of commodities, most notably ivory and gold, to be shipped
        northwards to Europe.

        The plundering and burning of the sugar plantations in France’s
        wealthiest colony had destroyed the established market for East African
        slaves in the Americas.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Sao José was thus a pioneer, hoping to find a new market for East
        African slaves in Brazil. This was no easy matter, as traders in Angola
        and the Congo monopolised the sale of slaves to Portuguese America.

        Middle Passage, the forced voyage of enslaved Africans across the
        Atlantic Ocean to the New World. It was one leg of the triangular trade
        route that took goods (such as knives, guns, ammunition, cotton cloth,
        tools, and brass dishes) from Europe to Africa, Africans to work as
        slaves in the Americas and West Indies, and items, mostly raw materials,
        produced on the plantations (sugar, rice, tobacco, indigo, rum, and
        cotton) back to Europe. From about 1518 to the mid-19th century,
        millions of African men, women, and children made the 21-to-90-day
        voyage aboard grossly overcrowded sailing ships manned by crews mostly
        from Great Britain, the Netherlands, Portugal, and France.
